Reusing one can cause it to break or tear, increasing the risk of pregnancy and STIs."},{question:"Do birth control pills protect against STIs?",answer:"No. Birth control pills only prevent pregnancy. To protect against STIs, use condoms in addition to the pill."},{question:"What if I miss my birth control pill?",answer:"Take the missed pill as soon as you remember. If you miss more than one, take the most recent missed pill and use backup protection like condoms for the next 7 days."},{question:"Is it safe to use emergency pills more than once?",answer:"Yes, it’s safe, but it should not be used as a regular contraceptive. Frequent use can cause irregular periods."},{question:"Do I need to rest after getting an IUD or implant?",answer:"You can resume normal activities immediately after the procedure, but mild cramping or soreness may occur for a few days."},{question:"Can contraception cause infertility?",answer:"No. Most contraceptive methods are fully reversible.

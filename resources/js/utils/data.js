        "Family planning is a shared responsibility that requires honesty, openness, and understanding. This post helps couples build confidence to start conversations about contraception, timing, and shared goals.",

        Talking about family planning is not only about avoiding pregnancy — it’s about building a shared vision for your future. Couples should create a safe space to express their thoughts and preferences freely.
  
        🌸 Key Points:

        - Be honest about your fears or doubts.
        - Learn together about available family planning methods (condoms, pills, injectables, implants, IUD, etc.).
        - Visit a health facility together for professional advice.
        - Respect your partner’s choices — it’s a shared decision.
  
        💡 Remember: Open communication strengthens love and helps prevent misunderstandings about SRHR.

      summary:
        "Strong relationships are built on trust, respect, and communication. For young couples, these values shape how love grows and how conflicts are resolved.",
      content: `
        Trust is the foundation of every healthy relationship. It allows partners to be open, honest, and supportive of each other. Without trust, even small misunderstandings can lead to big problems.
  
        🌿 Tips to Build Trust and Communication:
        - Always tell the truth, even when it’s hard.
        - Listen to understand, not just to reply.
        - Avoid keeping secrets or spying on your partner.
        - Use positive and respectful language during disagreements.
        - Spend quality time together to strengthen emotional bonds.
        - Appreciate small things — compliments build confidence.
  
        💬 Communication is not only about talking — it’s also about listening with empathy. When couples communicate well, they can make better SRHR and family planning decisions together.

      tags: ["Consent", "Respect", "Relationships", "SRHR Awareness"],
      summary:
        "Consent is the foundation of respect and equality in every relationship. It means both partners freely agree to what happens between them, emotionally or physically, without any form of pressure or fear.",
      content: `
        Consent is not just a word — it’s an ongoing agreement based on respect and understanding. Every person has the right to decide what happens to their own body and when.
  
        🌼 Important Points:
        - Consent means a clear, voluntary, and enthusiastic “YES”.
        - Silence or lack of resistance does not mean consent.
        - Consent can be withdrawn at any time.
        - Mutual respect means both partners value each other’s feelings and boundaries.
        - No one should ever be forced or guilted into anything.
        - Always check in with your partner: “Are you comfortable with this?”
  
        💡 Remember: True love respects boundaries. A healthy couple knows that consent protects trust and strengthens emotional safety.

INTRODUCTION
Dear Partners, Supporters, and Friends,
It is with immense gratitude and purpose that I welcome you to the Future of Family Planning Initiative (FFPI). This
organization was born from a deeply personal realization: that far too many women and girls in South Sudan — and
across East Africa — are still denied the basic right to make informed choices about their reproductive health. As a
clinical officer, innovator, and community leader, I have witnessed first-hand the consequences of limited access to
information, services, and support for young people, especially in remote and underserved areas.
At FFPI, we believe that family planning is not just a health issue — it is a matter of dignity, opportunity, and justice. It is
about ensuring that every adolescent girl can stay in school, that every woman can space her children safely, and that
every young person can plan for a future they choose. And in today’s world, we must leverage technology to make this a
reality.
Our journey began with a simple idea: to use digital tools to close the gap between information and access. That idea has
since grown into a bold, youth-led initiative that now empowers thousands through mobile platforms, digital learning, and
community engagement. Supported by partners such as GIZ and UNFPA, we are redefining how reproductive health
services are delivered — making them more inclusive, data-driven, and responsive to the needs of those often left behind.
This profile is more than a summary of our work. It is a reflection of the hope we carry, the challenges we face, and the
innovation we bring to transforming health systems. It is a call to action — to governments, donors, communities, and
individuals — to join us in reimagining a future where every woman and girl has the power to make informed choices.
On behalf of our passionate team, I thank you for your interest, support, and belief in our vision. We invite you to walk
this journey with us — because the future of family planning begins with us all.
Warm regards,
Anok Athor Deng
Founder & Executive Director

Making an informed decision about permanent birth control, tubal ligation or vasectomy is important.

There are many reasons individuals or partners consider permanent birth control: They’re worried about passing on a genetic disorder to a child, don’t want to have biological children or pregnancy poses a risk.

Dr. Nicholas Toepfer, a UCHealth urologist, and Dr. Chelsea Drake, a UCHealth OB/GYN, answer common questions about tubal ligations (tubes tied) and vasectomies to help with decision making.

Women’s permanent birth control options
What is tubal ligation?

Commonly known as “getting your tubes tied,’’ tubal ligation is a surgical procedure that prevents you from getting pregnant. The “tubal” part refers to the fallopian tubes, and “ligation” means tied off. Fallopian tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus and provide the passageway for unfertilized eggs. By tying a woman’s tubes, the eggs released each cycle cannot meet up with sperm for fertilization.

A tubal ligation doesn’t prevent sexually transmitted diseases.
Why would one want to get a tubal ligation?

Tubal ligation is a permanent birth control method that reduces the chances of getting pregnant to 1%. Unlike birth control pills and other methods, tubal ligation doesn’t affect a woman’s hormones, change periods or bring on menopause. There are no side effects, such as mood swings, weight gain, headaches, or cramping and spotting, that may come with other birth control methods.

Some women may choose to have a tubal ligation because they do not want children. Others may consider the option if pregnancy is a health risk or if one of the partners has a genetic disorder they want to avoid passing on to a child.
Does a tubal ligation lessen my chance of ovarian cancer? When might I want to consider it as preventative cancer care?

“We have learned that most cases of ovarian cancer start in the fimbriated ends (also known as fimbriae tubae), the small fingerlike projections at the end of the Fallopian tubes,” said Dr. Chelsea Drake, an obstetrician and gynecologist with UCHealth Women’s Care Clinic – Windsor.

Removing both Fallopian tubes, called a bilateral salpingectomy, decreases a woman’s future risk of ovarian cancer by about 50%. Partial salpingectomy reduces her risk by about 25%.

Hormonal birth control methods (such as IUDs, injections or pills) also decrease a woman’s risk of uterine, ovarian and colon cancer for all women, not just those with a genetic predisposition, she said.

Some women have genetic mutations that significantly increase their risk of ovarian cancer. Removal of Fallopian tubes (and ovaries) is recommended after a certain age in these women. People can talk to a genetic council to better understand the genetic risks of specific cancers and how to test for those risks.
How is tubal ligation done?

While under general, local or spinal anesthesia (similar to what is used during a cesarean section), an OB/GYN surgeon will block or cut both Fallopian tubes.

“The approach depends on timing and the surgical technique,” Drake said. “Your doctor will go over the details before surgery.”

The surgeon can either remove a piece of each Fallopian tube, called a partial salpingectomy, or completely remove the Fallopian tubes, called a bilateral salpingectomy. Other types use clips or bands applied to block the fallopian tubes or the tubes are burned (cauterized).

“Partial and complete salpingectomies are the most common techniques used these days,” Drake said.

At the time of cesarean delivery, any technique can be used, she said.

Immediately following a vaginal delivery, a small 3- to 4-centimeter incision is made below the belly button. The tubes are visualized through the incision, and a small piece of each tube is removed, or clips or bands are used, Drake said. Cauterization and bilateral salpingectomy are not used in this scenario. This procedure is done under general or spinal anesthesia, and most women go home the next day.

In cases remote from pregnancy, called interval sterilization, the surgeon will make one or more small incisions near the belly button or, in some cases, in the lower abdomen. Using a small laparoscope (camera), they find the Fallopian tubes and either remove, clamp, band or seal off the tubes with an electric current. The incisions are then closed with one to two stitches. Tubal ligation is an outpatient surgical procedure, and most patients can go home the same day.

In all scenarios of tubal ligation, the skin is closed with dissolvable sutures.
Are there qualifications I have to meet, such as being a certain age, to get a tubal ligation?

In general, a woman requesting a tubal ligation must be at least 18 years of age and capable of giving informed consent. There are no fertility or other health prerequisites, Drake said.

Medicaid requires women to be at least 21 years of age. Some insurance providers, including Medicaid, require consent forms to be signed at least 30 days in advance. Those consent forms are the same as for any surgical procedure and do not require spousal/significant other approval or co-signature, Drake said.

“As women’s health care providers, we strive to educate patients and engage in shared decision-making,” Drake said. “It is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of permanent sterilization compared to reversible forms of contraception. We don’t want anyone rushing into a permanent decision like this. The risk of regret is about 20% in women under age 30, compared to about 5% in women over 30.”
Will insurance pay for a tubal ligation?

Most insurance companies consider this elective surgery and will cover at least a portion of the cost. Co-pays do exist, depending on your insurance provider and specific plan.
What is the recovery time?

Recovery times for tubal ligations are different based on the scenario:

    Recovery is six weeks if performed at the time of a C-section, the same as if a C-section was performed without tubal ligation.
    Recovery is two weeks if performed laparoscopic outside of pregnancy or immediately following vaginal delivery.

Patients should not lift heavy objects during the recovery period or engage in strenuous activities such as exercise. They can perform most normal day-to-day activities.
What are the side effects of tubal ligation? Will there be scars?

Tubal ligation does not affect hormones or periods, so there are no long-term side effects if the surgery is uncomplicated. There will be small scars on your abdomen, Drake said.
What is post ablation tubal sterilization syndrome, and should I be worried about it?

Post ablation tubal sterilization syndrome (PATSS) is a condition that can occur in women who have had both an endometrial ablation and tubal ligation.

“Endometrial ablation is a surgical procedure to treat heavy menstrual bleeding but does not prevent pregnancy,” Drake said. “Women who have had this procedure must continue using effective contraception as pregnancy becomes a high risk.”

PATSS is characterized by cyclic pelvic pain due to menstrual blood trapped inside the uterus or fallopian tubes due to scar tissue. In some cases, pain is alleviated by completely removing the fallopian tubes or using hormones to suppress menstruation. Other times a hysterectomy is necessary.
Can doctors perform a tubal ligation after my vaginal delivery or C-section? What are the benefits of doing it during that time?

Tubal ligation can be performed at the same time as cesarean delivery. You and your doctor will discuss the specific technique. Benefits include avoiding a second surgical procedure. It does not change the type of anesthesia used for cesarean delivery. The doctor would still use a spinal or epidural unless general anesthesia is needed.

Tubal ligation also can be performed within a few days of vaginal delivery before being discharged from the hospital, also under spinal or general anesthesia. In this case, you don’t have to return to the hospital another time.
Can tubal ligation be reversed?

Tubal ligation is not recommended if a patient has any doubts they may want to have biological children in the future, Drake said.

Another surgery can reverse tubal ligation, called tubal reanastomosis or tubal anastomosis, but only about 50-80% of women can become pregnant after having their Fallopian tubes reattached.

“Live birth rates after tubal reanastomosis are about 50%, similar to success rates with IVF,” Drake said. “The risk of ectopic pregnancy is 2 to 3%. It also is difficult to find a surgeon who is experienced in performing this procedure.”

An ectopic pregnancy is where a fertilized egg attaches outside the uterus. It can be life-threatening if untreated.
Can I get pregnant after having a tubal ligation? And if so, is there an increased risk for complications or miscarriage?

Drake breaks down the failure rates (the chance of getting pregnant after using specific birth control methods):

“Failure rates for tubal ligation are about 1% but vary depending on the technique,” Drake said.

    Partial salpingectomy has a failure rate of about 1% over 10 years.
    Burning the tubes and using a clip or band have failure rates of 2 to 3% over 10 years.
    Pregnancy is exceedingly rare with the complete removal of both Fallopian tubes. There are case reports in the literature, but it is so rare it’s difficult to assign a percentage.

Contraceptive implant failure rates:

    Nexplanon failure rate 0.05%
    Copper IUD failure rate 1.5%
    Progesterone IUD failure rate 0.5 to 1%

Will I continue to have my period or undergo menopause after a tubal ligation? Does it help with those side effects, such as cramping?

A tubal ligation does not affect hormones, periods, the timing of menopause or menstrual symptoms.
Does tubal ligation lead to early menopause?

No, tubal ligation doesn’t affect the timing of menopause.
Does a tubal ligation affect sex?

No, a tubal ligation doesn’t physically affect sex, nor does it affect one’s hormones.
Can cut Fallopian tubes grow again?

After partial salpingectomy, the cut ends of the Fallopian tubes can heal back together and lead to pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy. As mentioned before, the failure risk of a partial salpingectomy is about 1%.

If the Fallopian tubes are completely removed, they do not grow back.
With tubal ligation, are there increased or decreased risks for other issues, such as ovarian cancer?

Because we now know that most cases of ovarian cancer start in the fimbriated ends of the fallopian tubes, a bilateral salpingectomy decreases a woman’s future risk of ovarian cancer by about 50%, Drake said. A partial salpingectomy reduces her risk by about 25%.
How is a tubal ligation different than a hysterectomy?

Tubal ligation is a minor surgical procedure compared to hysterectomy, with a shorter operating time, lower risk of complications, and quicker recovery period.

Complete hysterectomy refers to the removal of the uterus and cervix. Partial hysterectomy means the cervix is left behind (rarely done, usually only in particular circumstances). The Fallopian tubes are generally removed at the time of hysterectomy. The ovaries can be removed or left behind depending on a woman’s age and situation.
Can I get a hysterectomy to prevent me from having children?

“Hysterectomy is never done solely for contraception,” Drake said.

A hysterectomy is a major operation and is recommended as a treatment option for certain diseases only when other options have been unsuccessful. While a hysterectomy does result in sterilization, it is not performed for this reason alone.
When and why does a woman get a hysterectomy?

Again, a hysterectomy is only used when other treatment options have not worked. It is a major surgical procedure to remove the uterus and has a longer recovery time than less invasive treatments.

Health problems that affect the female reproductive system, such as heavy periods, long-term pelvic pain, non-cancerous tumors (fibroids) and cancers of the ovaries, uterus, cervix or fallopian tubes, may require a hysterectomy.

Hysterectomy may be performed for gynecologic cancers, for genetic mutations that place a woman at high risk for uterine cancer, in women with heavy periods or pelvic pain after medical therapy has failed, or in women undergoing surgical repair of pelvic organ prolapse.
Vasectomy: men’s permanent birth control option
What are a male’s permanent birth control options?

A vasectomy is one of the most effective birth control options for men, but it is “permanent.” The outpatient procedure done under local anesthesia is performed by a surgeon and is where they cut and seal the tubes that carry sperm.
How is a vasectomy performed?

There are two types of methods used to perform a vasectomy, but the ‘no-scalpel technique’ is the only one used at UCHealth.
Dr. Nicholas Toepfer, a UCHealth urologist
Dr. Nicholas Toepfer, a UCHealth urologist.

“The “no-scalpel technique” is the gold standard procedure now,” said Dr. Nicholas Toepfer, a urologist at UCHealth Urology Clinic – Colorado Springs. “This is done through a small opening, resulting in less pain, fewer complications and faster recovery.”

He said his patients meet with him before the 20-minute procedure to discuss details. If his patients feel they need an anti-anxiety medication, one is given by mouth one hour before the appointment.

The technique for the procedure varies by the surgeon, Toepfer said. He said he cuts a 1-centimeter segment of the vas deferens, the long tube that transports mature sperm to the urethra in preparation for ejaculation. He then cauterizes the inner channel of the tube on each end to cause the channel to scar down and become obstructed, after which he ties off each end with an absorbable suture that dissolves over a few months.

“This has to be done on both sides,” he said. “These three techniques reassure us that a failure is very unlikely.

“The opening used during the procedure is so small that in most cases, a stitch is not necessary to close the incision, and you can barely see the opening after one week,” Toepfer said. “I do not use metal clips that some doctors use, so patients do not have to worry about having metal in their bodies after the procedure.”

A vasectomy results in the sperm not being able to travel up the vas deferens, and therefore, the man’s semen does not have sperm in it.

“It is important to know that men aren’t sterile until three months after the procedure,” Toepfer said. “That is when a semen analysis is performed confirming that other forms of birth control are no longer necessary.”
Why might a couple choose one option of permanent birth control (vasectomy vs. tubal ligation) over another?

“Vasectomy has the lowest risk of failure (unwanted pregnancy) among all sterilization or birth control options, including tubal ligation,” Toepfer said.

Vasectomy failures occur in only 0.03-0.05% of men who have a vasectomy.
Does insurance pay for a vasectomy?

Most insurance companies will cover the cost of a vasectomy that is done in an outpatient setting. You should always check with your insurance provider before undergoing an elective procedure to understand your out-of-pocket costs, including co-pays, deductibles or out-of-network provider fees.

If you don’t have insurance, check with the health care provider to see what options you might have within the community.

“Many men choose to have their vasectomy in the same calendar year as the birth of their youngest child, so they have already met their family deductible,” Toepfer said.
Is a vasectomy operation painful?

The procedure is performed using local anesthesia, so patients feel very little during the process.

In most cases, your doctor will recommend you take it easy for a few days, using over-the-counter ibuprofen, ice and tight-fitting underwear.

“Most men report the discomfort after the procedure as very mild and don’t need or want to take prescription medication,” he said.
How long does the discomfort after a vasectomy last? And what is the total recovery time?

There is no limitation to walking or leaving the house. In most cases, patients can resume “normal daily activity” on the same day as the procedure.

Men should refrain from sexual activity, exercising or heavy lifting (greater than 15 pounds) for seven days after a vasectomy.

“For most men who have the procedure on a Friday, they are back to work on Monday. And men who work from home find they need little or no time off from work,” Toepfer said. “Men who have jobs requiring strenuous activity or heavy living will need to be limited to light duty for one week.”
Does a vasectomy affect sex?

A vasectomy has no impact on erectile function, libido or sexual functions and sensations. It does not change testosterone values. Men will still ejaculate when they orgasm, but there will be no sperm in the semen.
Does a vasectomy lead to testicle atrophy over time, or does it increase one’s risk of prostate cancer?

A vasectomy does not lead to atrophy over time or cause the testicles to feel different. The testicle will continue to make normal amounts of testosterone and sperm, and the sperm will reabsorb once it has lived its expected lifespan.

Studies have proven that there is no increased risk of prostate cancer or other diseases in men who have had a vasectomy, Toepfer said.
Are there requirements, such as age or having had children, to be able to get a vasectomy?

There is no age requirement to have a vasectomy (besides being 18), and you do not have to be married or have had children.

“Because the procedure is intended to be permanent, we ask men to go into the procedure close to 100% certain that they do not want more biological children,” Toepfer said.
Can a vasectomy be reversed?

“Yes,” Toepfer said. “But we do not support men having a vasectomy if they think it is likely they will want a reversal in the future.”

Vasectomy reversals are often not covered by insurance. It can become an expensive out-of-pocket cost because it’s done in an operating room under general anesthesia.

People’s circumstances and minds do change, so if someone wants to have children after a vasectomy, there are options,” he said. “But if someone is not sure they are finished having children, non-permanent birth-control options are probably best.”
Are there any other permanent birth control options out there?

“Not for men,” Toepfer said. “Tubal ligation and other procedures for women are options, but they usually have a higher risk of complications and may cost more.

9 min read

Hormonal implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) are both safe and dependable methods of birth control.

They’re called long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). These “fit-and-forget” methods last years. Once they go in, you don’t have to do anything else to prevent pregnancy.

When you compare IUDs vs. implants, there are key similarities and differences.
IUD vs. Implant Similarities

Whether you choose an implant or an IUD can come down to many factors, including how long you want your birth control to last. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images.)

Both IUDs and implants are very effective — your chance of getting pregnant is less than 1 in 100 during the first year of use. By comparison, nearly 10 in 100 birth control pill users get pregnant in the first year.

Implants and IUDs are alike in other ways too. A doctor or nurse has to insert and remove them — you can’t do it yourself. Both are reversible. You can get pregnant as soon as they’re removed. They’re more expensive at first than other kinds of birth control, but that cost evens out over time.

Neither method prevents sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but you can use them with a condom to reduce your risk for STDs.
How Do Implants and IUDs Work?

An IUD is a tiny T-shaped device that goes inside your uterus. There are two types: hormonal and copper.

The hormonal IUD releases the hormone progestin into your body. It prevents pregnancy by:

    Making the mucus in your cervical canal too thick for sperm to get through
    Stopping your ovaries from releasing eggs
    Preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the lining of your uterus

The copper IUD is wrapped in thin copper wire that’s toxic to sperm. It also keeps a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. After birth control pills, IUDs are the second most popular form of reversible contraception. In the U.S., about 15% of people choose IUDs for long-term birth control.

A hormonal implant is a tiny tube about the size of a matchstick that goes under the skin of your upper arm. It releases a small amount of progestin to stop your ovaries from releasing eggs and make the mucus in the cervix too thick for sperm to get through. You'll need to review all your medications with your doctor beforehand. Some drugs can make implants less effective.

    What Happens After Stopping Birth Control?

How long do IUDs and implants last?

A hormonal IUD works for 3–8 years, depending on the brand. A copper IUD works for up to 10 years.

According to the FDA, these are the expected lifespans for different brands of IUDs:

    Paragard: 10 years
    Mirena: Eight years
    Liletta: Up to eight years
    Kyleena: Five years
    Skyla: Three years

Your doctor may decide you can use safely use the device longer.

An implant works for up to three years.

How soon do IUDs and implants start working?

Copper IUDs start to work as soon as they’re inserted. The hormonal kind will work right away if you put it in during the first seven days of your period. Otherwise, it may take up to seven days to prevent pregnancy.

An implant works right away if you get it within the first five days of your period. If you get it after that time, you’ll need to use condoms for at least seven days to avoid getting pregnant.
IUD vs. Implant Insertion Procedure

Before you get an IUD, your health care provider will test you for STDs. Putting one in when you have an STD could cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious infection. Your provider also may test you to make sure you’re not pregnant.

The nurse or doctor will use a special tool to put the IUD through the opening in your cervix and into your uterus. It usually takes just a few minutes. The IUD has strings attached that your provider can use to remove the device later.

You might have cramps during the insertion. Experts say that most patients do well with IUD insertion. However, recently people have begun to call for more information about the pain associated with the procedure. As a result, the CDC has issued new guidelines.

Doctors are encouraged to discuss any concerns you have about your pain ahead of time. If you're worried, you can ask for medication that will numb the area and make you more comfortable.

To insert an implant into your arm, your provider will first give you a shot to numb the area. Then, they use a special device to place the implant under your skin. It takes only a few minutes, and no stitches are needed. They will tell you how to care for the skin in that area in the days after you get the implant.

Usually, you can’t see the implant under your skin, but you’ll be able to feel it with your fingers. The spot may be sore for a few days, and you may have a bruise.

    What Happens After Stopping Birth Control?

IUD vs. Implant Side Effects

After you get a hormonal IUD, your menstrual cramps may hurt less and your period may be lighter. Side effects such as irregular periods and spotting between periods can happen but usually go away in three to six months. Copper IUDs can cause heavy bleeding, cramps, and bleeding between periods.

The strings attached to your IUD may feel stiff at first, something your partner might notice during sex. They usually soften over time.

Implants can make your period very light or go away, and ease cramps and pain. The most common side effect is spotting in the first 6-12 months. Other side effects such as headaches, weight gain, tender breasts, acne, and mood changes can happen but aren’t very common.

Heavy bleeding isn’t normal with an implant. If that happens, keep track of how many pads or tampons you use, and call your doctor right away.
IUD vs. Implant Safety Considerations

Almost everyone can safely use IUDs and implants, including teens and those who haven’t had a baby. However, some conditions make IUDs and implants unsafe for you to use.

Don’t use either kind of IUD if you:

    Have vaginal bleeding when you’re not on your period
    Have cancer of the cervix or uterus
    Have AIDS
    Are pregnant or want to get pregnant
    Have breast cancer
    Have liver tumors
    Have liver disease
    Have an increased risk for STD/PID
    Have abnormal uterine anatomy

Don’t use a hormonal implant if you:

    Are pregnant
    Have liver disease
    Have had breast cancer
    Have vaginal bleeding that’s not your period

IUD vs. Implant Complications

Although long-acting reversible contraception is generally safe, complications can happen.
IUD complications

These events are rare but can be serious.

IUD expulsion. Your IUD can come out by itself, and you may not feel it happen. Get in touch with your doctor if you:

    Can’t feel the IUD strings
    Can feel the IUD in your cervix
    Have fluid or odor coming from your vagina
    Have persistent pain

IUD moving through the uterine wall. The device could push through the wall of your uterus. If it happens when your doctor is putting it in, they can fix it right away. If it isn’t fixed right away, the IUD could damage nearby organs, so it will have to be taken out.

    What Are the Side Effects of Birth Control?

Ectopic pregnancy. In rare cases, you might get pregnant while using an IUD. There’s a higher chance that you could have an ectopic pregnancy, when the baby develops outside the uterus. This is a medical emergency. Call your doctor right away if you feel sharp or cramping pain in your lower stomach that lasts more than a few minutes.

Infection. When your IUD is placed in your body, there's a possibility that bacteria may enter, which could lead to infection. This problem is most likely to happen in the first 20 days after insertion. Your doctor should clean your cervix before placing your IUD, which will help protect against infection.

Birth control implant complications

Implant removal. Your implant might move or start to come out. This is more likely to happen the first month after you get it. As time goes on, the tissue around the implant should thicken, which will help keep it in place. If you notice your implant coming out, start using another birth control method right away and see your doctor as soon as possible.

Implant damage. If you've had an accident that caused trauma to your arm, your implant might shift, bend, or even break. If you think this might have happened, call your doctor.

Scarring. You might have a scar at the spot where the doctor made the incision in your arm to insert the implant.

Ectopic pregnancy. The risk of getting pregnant while you have the implant is very low. But if you do conceive, the risk that the pregnancy will be ectopic is higher.
IUD vs. Implant Removal

You may have your IUD or implant removed if you want to become pregnant, switch to a different form of birth control, or if the device is at the end of its use.

When you're ready to have your IUD removed, make an appointment with your doctor. They'll use an instrument to grab the strings and pull the IUD out. It usually takes less time to remove an IUD than it does to place one. If you want a new IUD, you can get it during the same visit.

To remove an implant, your doctor will first numb that area of your arm. They'll make a small cut and remove the implant. It takes only a few minutes. If you want a new implant, your doctor can insert it during the same procedure.

Cost Comparison

You may not have to pay for either one of them. Family planning clinics usually will provide an implant, IUD, or some other form of safe birth control at little or no cost to you.

Your insurance company may pay for some or all of your birth control, though this might or might not include implant or IUD options. Call your insurance to be sure.

If you pay yourself, expect around $1,000 for the implant plus a few hundred dollars to place it. Once in, it can last up to three years. There might also be a charge of a few hundred dollars to remove the implant.

An IUD may cost as much as $1,300, depending on the type. Because both types can last for many years, the cost is similar to methods that you take or change more frequently, such as the pill or the ring.
IUD vs. Implant: Which One Should You Choose?

Which method you choose is a personal decision. Your doctor can answer questions and guide you. Some points to keep in mind:

    Most IUDs last longer than implants.
    Do you want your periods to be lighter or stop?
    Are you looking for relief from painful periods?
    You'll need a pelvic exam when you get your IUD.

Takeaways

Both IUDs and hormonal implants are long-lasting birth control methods that are simple to reverse. They're popular because they're very effective at preventing pregnancy. Whether you choose an IUD or implant, your health care provider will have to place it. Some people have side effects, including cramps and spotting. Possible complications include infection and ectopic pregnancy, but those are rare. When you're ready to remove the device, it will take only a few minutes for your doctor to take it out.
IUD vs. Implant FAQs
What are the main differences between implants and IUDs?

Both are forms of long-acting birth control. An implant is inserted in your arm through a small incision. An IUD is placed inside your body during a pelvic exam.

    Is Weight Loss Common After Stopping Birth Control?

When your doctor places an implant, your arm is numbed before your skin is cut. The site might be tender and sore for a few days. Most people have some cramping — from mild to intense — when they get an IUD. The CDC has recently issued new guidelines designed to address complaints about painful IUD insertions. You can ask your doctor for numbing medicine before the procedure if you're concerned.
Where can you get IUDs and birth control implants?

If you have a gynecologist you see regularly, they can advise you and place either device. You also can get IUDs and implants at low-cost family planning clinics.
Do you gain weight on arm birth control?

Studies show that weight gain is not a direct side effect of hormonal birth control implants. However, some implant users say they feel bloated or have gained weight.

Clinical Question

Which form of emergency contraception is the safest and most effective for preventing pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected intercourse?

Evidence-Based Answer

Oral mifepristone (Mifeprex), ulipristal (Ella), levonorgestrel-releasing emergency contraception (Plan B One-Step), ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel, and the copper intrauterine device (IUD; Paragard) are safe and effective for emergency contraception. 1 (Strength of Recommendation [SOR]: B, based on inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence.)

In head-to-head comparisons, a one-time dose of mifepristone is more effective than any dose of oral levonorgestrel, with moderate-dose mifepristone (25 to 50 mg) being more effective than low-dose mifepristone (less than 25 mg; relative risk [RR] = 0.61). (SOR: B, based on inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence.) All other forms of emergency contraception are more effective than ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel (RR = 0.57). (SOR: A, based on consistent, good-quality patient-oriented evidence.) Ulipristal is more effective than oral levonorgestrel alone (RR = 0.59). (SOR: A, based on consistent, good-quality patient-oriented evidence.)

The copper IUD is not inferior to any dose of mifepristone, but no direct comparison has been made between the copper IUD and other types of emergency contraception. (SOR: C, based on consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, expert opinion, or case series.) Adverse effects most often include nausea and vomiting for oral medications and abdominal pain and menorrhagia for the copper IUD.1

Practice Pointers

Emergency contraception is the use of a medication or device to prevent pregnancy following unprotected intercourse. Although the likelihood of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected intercourse is highly variable depending on timing and other factors, emergency contraception can be more than 95% effective at preventing pregnancy when used within five days of intercourse. Nearly one-half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and they are associated with increased health risks to both mother and fetus.2 The authors of this review sought to identify the safest and most effective emergency contraception.

This Cochrane review included 115 randomized controlled trials, 92 of which were performed in China, and involved 60,479 women who had engaged in a single act of unprotected intercourse.1 Both one-time low-dose (less than 25 mg) and moderate-dose (25 to 50 mg) oral mifepristone were superior when compared with one-time oral levonorgestrel, 1.5 mg (RR for low-dose mifepristone = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.99; n = 8,752; RR for moderate-dose mifepristone = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.83; n = 6,052). For example, if the chance of pregnancy following unprotected intercourse and subsequent treatment with oral levonorgestrel is 20 women per 1,000, the chance following treatment with low-dose mifepristone would be between 10 and 20 women per 1,000. In a different cohort, if the chance of pregnancy following treatment with oral levonorgestrel is 35 women per 1,000, then the chance after taking moderate-dose mifepristone is between 16 and 29 women per 1,000. One study confirmed that oral levonorgestrel can be given as a single dose or as two doses 12 hours apart, but no difference in effectiveness was demonstrated between single and split dosing; other studies compared single-dose regimens.

All one-time doses of oral ulipristal, most often 30 mg, were more effective than oral levonorgestrel alone (RR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.99; n = 3,448). If the chance of pregnancy following unprotected sex and treatment with oral levonorgestrel is 22 women per 1,000, the chance following treatment with ulipristal is eight to 22 per 1,000.

Ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel was found to be inferior to one-time oral levonorgestrel (RR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.84; n = 4,750) and one-time mifepristone (RR = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.4; n = 2,144). In other words, if the chance of pregnancy following treatment with ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel is 29 women per 1,000, then the chance following treatment with oral levonorgestrel is between 11 and 24 women per 1,000. In the mifepristone studies, if the chance of pregnancy after taking ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel is 25 women per 1,000, the chance after taking a single dose of mifepristone is one to 10 per 1,000.

A single study comparing the effectiveness of the copper IUD and moderate-dose mifepristone (25 to 50 mg) at preventing pregnancy revealed no significant difference between the two treatments (RR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.04 to 2.74; n = 395).

No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the studies. Nausea and vomiting were most common in patients taking oral medications, with mifepristone and oral levonorgestrel having lower rates than ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel. Menstrual delay occurred most often in those taking mifepristone vs. any other intervention, and this appeared to be dose-dependent. Users of ulipristal were more likely to experience delayed resumption of menses compared with those who took oral levonorgestrel (RR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.42 to 19.2; n = 3,593). Women who used copper IUDs were at risk of uterine perforation and/or expulsion, abdominal pain, and menorrhagia.3,4

The 2015 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists practice bulletin on emergency contraception recommends ulipristal, oral levonorgestrel, and the copper IUD as effective forms of emergency contraception.3 (SOR: A, based on consistent, good-quality patient-oriented evidence.) Because ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel is often the only method available, physicians should be familiar with its dosing regimens. They should also be educated on all of the available methods so that they can provide compassionate and timely emergency contraception to their patients.
